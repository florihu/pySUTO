# CONTEXT — pySUTO glossary

The canonical glossary lives in [README.md](README.md) §"Glossary / vocabulary". This file
captures terms sharpened during design/grilling sessions that the README does not yet state
precisely. Glossary only — no implementation details.

## Concordance vocabulary

**Fan-out** — *one* source edge distributed across several root edges, arising when a raw row
classifies **only one endpoint** (the other endpoint is left open as `"<any>"` and resolved by
normalised weights). Mass-preserving: the source value is *split* across the fan, weights sum to 1.

**Replication (anti-pattern, not a concordance shape)** — the failure mode where a single raw
row that classifies only one endpoint is materialised into *many distinct source edges* (one per
matching value of the open endpoint), each carrying the **full** raw value. This is **not**
fan-out; it inflates total mass by the fan cardinality. Distinguished from fan-out by counting
*distinct src edges per raw row*: fan-out = 1 (→ many roots); replication = many. See
[ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-single-endpoint-rows-fan-out-not-replicate.md).

**Boundary topology** *(referenced by [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-replace-coherence-sum-eq-with-bilateral-anchoring.md); to be expanded)* —
the open System-Boundary (SB) endpoints where flows terminate, so prior disagreement there does
not create feasibility conflicts.

## Accounting-structure invariants

**Sector → entity is 1:1** — every *concrete* root sector maps to exactly one entity kind
(`Flow` | `Process` | `SB`), so entity is functionally determined once the sector is known.
**Caveat:** an **open (`"<any>"`) sector does not determine an entity** — an unclassified endpoint
can match producers across several entities (e.g. a real `Flow` source *and* the `SB`
system-boundary/import source). Concordance code must therefore make the entity `"<any>"` whenever
its sector is `"<any>"`, not pin it to a concrete edge entity. See
[ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-single-endpoint-rows-fan-out-not-replicate.md).
