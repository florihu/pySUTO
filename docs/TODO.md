# Harmonize registry. done
* registry harmonization for feed, imp, const solve registry
    * pattern is always stage id (feed, imp, const, opt)+ datet time + random code !! label lives only in registry

* input registry for data feeds, accs min id + version + date + random code see (const imp feed) label only in jason -> these are initialized when the init script is initilized and contain only minimal information.... extend with label var if not in meta 
    * for feeds lives in data/input/feed
    * for acc lives in data/input/acc
    * params lives in data/input/params

## ADR 0017's reference leg size drifts with the population it prices

`a_ref` is the **median of the covered bilateral legs**, so cleaning the leg
population moves it. The ADR 0027 netting removes the small hub-side legs and the
median rises (Concentrate 10.26 → 12.0 kt, Anode 0.21 → ~0.3); a higher `a_ref`
raises the damped cv of every surviving leg, looser legs are cheaper for the QP to
delete, and deleting them makes the independently anchored scale-total rows worse.
So **improving the trade matrix silently loosens σ on what survives** — the rule
penalises the cleaner population.

Measured (`opt_20260916_072151_ac748919`, the shipped chain with the pin off):
sum-row z² 1,748,645 vs 1,720,192 (**+1.7 %**), Chile concentrate retention
0.574 → **0.550**, world CO Mass 0.779 → 0.767, Concentrate CC 0.872 → 0.864.
30/30 Solved. REP `…roundL1-baci-reexport` Addendum 3.

`LEG_SIGMA_AREF` in `collect_aggregate_impute.py` currently pins the L.0 medians.
**Do not just restore the `None` default** — that is the worse configuration, and
it is the measurement above that says so. Decide instead: a per-sector constant, a
quantile of the *gross* matrix, or a physically motivated size — something that does
not move when the matrix it prices gets better.

## Chile's mine chain (the named next round)

The model deletes ~31 % of Chile's ICSG-reported mine output and ~60 % of its ore in
every run, the shipped baseline included. See [[chile-mine-chain-deletion]] /
REP `…roundL1-baci-reexport` Addendum 2. Under investigation.
